# üçé Simple Nutrition Assistant ü•¶

This project provides a simple interface for obtaining nutrition information about common foods using the Gemini AI model. It leverages a local nutrition dataset and the power of large language models to deliver informative and helpful insights.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A Google Cloud account and API key with access to the Gemini API.
*   Python 3.6 or higher.
*   The following Python libraries:
    *   `pandas`
    *   `gradio`
    *   `google-generativeai`

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Set your Google API key in the Python script (replace `"AIzaSyCNllmyInek_kwzPNbsAhWZzX3vAffnH9k"` with your actual key).
    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Warning:** For production environments, it's highly recommended to store your API key securely using environment variables or a secrets management system.  **DO NOT** hardcode your API key directly into the code.

### Running the Application

Execute the Python script.

This will launch a Gradio interface in your web browser.

## üí° Usage

1.  Enter the name of a food item (e.g., "Apple", "Chicken Breast") in the text input field.
2.  Click the "Submit" button.
3.  The application will display the nutrition information for the entered food item, generated by the Gemini AI model, in the output field.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality

The application consists of the following key components:

*   **Nutrition Dataset:** A Pandas DataFrame containing nutrition information (Calories, Protein, Carbs, Fat) for a limited set of common foods.

*   **`get_nutrition_info(food_name)`:** This function searches the nutrition dataset for the provided food name. If found, it returns a formatted string containing the nutrition information. If not found, it returns an "item not found" message.

*   **`nutrition_llm(food_name)`:** This function takes a food name as input, retrieves the nutrition information using `get_nutrition_info`, and constructs a prompt for the Gemini AI model.  The prompt instructs the model to act as a helpful nutrition assistant.  The function then calls the Gemini model to generate a response and returns the model's text output.

*   **Gradio Interface:** A user-friendly web interface built using Gradio that allows users to input a food name and view the generated nutrition information.

## ü§ñ Model

The application utilizes the `models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest` Gemini AI model (or another suitable model identified through experimentation).

## More information

*   The nutrition dataset is limited. If a food item is not found in the dataset, the application will not be able to provide nutrition information.

*   The accuracy of the generated nutrition information depends on the accuracy of the underlying nutrition dataset and the capabilities of the Gemini AI model.

*   The `available_models` code (which searches for a suitable working model) has been removed, as it is assumed that the `models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest` will remain operational. To re-enable model discovery, re-introduce the corresponding code blocks from previous iterations.

*   The hardcoded API key in this example is a placeholder and a significant security risk. **Replace it with your actual API key and use secure API key management practices for production deployments.**
